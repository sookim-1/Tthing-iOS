## Overview

<img src="appIcon.png" alt="logo" width="80" height="80">

Many everyday items like toothbrushes, towels, and razor blades have recommended replacement periods for hygiene and health reasons, but they're easy to forget. **Tthing** solves this problem by helping you track these consumables and notifying you when it's time to replace them.

Simply register a product by selecting its category, and the app automatically suggests appropriate replacement intervals. You'll receive timely push notifications so you never miss a replacement date.
